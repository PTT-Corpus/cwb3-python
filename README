This is a Python wrapper to the low-level API of CQP which allows
you to access CQP corpora in the same way as Perl's CWB::CL

To give you an idea how this works, see the following sample:

--- 8< ---
from CWB.CL import Corpus

# open the corpus
corpus=Corpus('TUEPP')
# get sentences and words
sentences=corpus.attribute('s','s')
words=corpus.attribute('word','p')
postags=corpus.attribute('pos','p')
# retrieve offsets of the 1235th sentence (0-based)
s_1234=sentences[1234]

for w,p in zip(words[s_1234[0]:s_1234[1]+1],postags[s_1234[0]:s_1234[1]+1]):
    print "%s/%s"%(w,p)
